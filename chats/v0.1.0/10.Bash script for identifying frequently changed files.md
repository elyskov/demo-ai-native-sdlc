User: please generate a Bash script that identifies the most frequently changed files in the repository, using Git history.
this script should top 15 files (first column), ordered by number of changes, with number of changes for each (second column).
save this script as a file in the root.

GitHub Copilot: I’m going to add a small root-level Bash script that parses `git log` file lists, counts how often each path appears across commits, and prints the top 15 as `file<TAB>count` sorted by count.

Created [](file:///home/<user>/Projects/demo-ai-native-sdlc/most-changed-files.sh)

Ran terminal command:  bash most-changed-files.sh 5 | cat

Added a root-level script: most-changed-files.sh

- Prints the top 15 files by “times mentioned in `git log --name-only`”, as: `file<TAB>count` (file in first column, count in second), sorted descending.
- Defaults to excluding merge commits; set `INCLUDE_MERGES=1` to include them.
- Usage: `bash most-changed-files.sh` (top 15) or `bash most-changed-files.sh 30` (top 30)

If you want it to be runnable via most-changed-files.sh, run `chmod +x most-changed-files.sh`.

Made changes.

User: please enhance the script output as follows::
- `number of changes` should be aligned vertically (left-aligned), at approximately the 60th position
- if the file name is longer than 50 characters, it should be shortened by replacing the corresponding number of characters in the middle with `...`

GitHub Copilot: I’m going to tweak the final formatting stage of the script so it shortens long paths to 50 chars with a middle `...`, then prints the (possibly shortened) path padded to 60 characters so the change-count column lines up.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```


Ran terminal command:  bash most-changed-files.sh 5 | cat

Updated most-changed-files.sh output formatting.

- The change-count column now starts at ~character 60 via `printf "%-60s%s\n" ...` (left-aligned).
- File paths longer than 50 characters are shortened with a middle `...` (display length stays 50).

Made changes.
