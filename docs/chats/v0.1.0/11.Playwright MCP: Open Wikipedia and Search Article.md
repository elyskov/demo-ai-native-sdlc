User: using Playwright MCP please open wikipedia.org and find an article about MCP.
use Playwright bundled firefox/chromium, no system browser.

GitHub Copilot: I’m going to drive the Playwright MCP browser (bundled Playwright engine, not your system browser) to wikipedia.org, search for “MCP”, and open the most relevant MCP article/disambiguation page.

Ran Navigate to a URL 

Next I’ll take an accessibility snapshot so I can locate the Wikipedia search field and run the MCP search.

Ran Page snapshot 

I can do this, but I’m blocked right now because the Playwright MCP calls are running and then **the results aren’t being shared back to me** (“user chose not to share the results”), so I can’t see the page to click/type.

Please do one of these, then tell me and I’ll continue:

- When VS Code prompts after the Playwright MCP action, click **Share/Allow** so the page snapshot/results are returned to me.
- If there’s a “always allow for this session/server” option for `microsoft/playwright-mcp`, enable it.

Two quick clarifiers so I open the right “MCP” article:
- Do you mean **Model Context Protocol** or **Microsoft Certified Professional** (or just the **MCP** disambiguation page)?

User: Playwright MCP works correctly, but Playwright tries to open system browser (Chrome) which is not installed on this machine. please refomlulate MCP command and explictly ask to use built-in Firefox browser (not system Chrome)?

GitHub Copilot: I’m going to quickly check the `@playwright/mcp` CLI flags so we can pin it to Playwright’s bundled Firefox (not system Chrome) in your `mcp.json`.

Playwright MCP supports a `--browser` flag. Set it to Firefox so it won’t try to launch system Chrome.

Update your MCP server config args from:

- `["@playwright/mcp@latest"]`

to:

- `["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--browser=firefox"]`

Example:

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "microsoft/playwright-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--browser=firefox"]
    }
  },
  "inputs": []
}
```

If it still errors about missing browsers, install Playwright’s bundled Firefox once on this machine:

- `npx playwright install firefox` (or `npx playwright install --with-deps firefox` on some Linux images)

User: I have updated MCP configuration. let's try again.

GitHub Copilot: Now that the MCP server is configured for Firefox, I’ll re-open Wikipedia, search for “Model Context Protocol (MCP)”, and open the most relevant article page.

Ran Navigate to a URL 
Completed with input: {
  "url": "https://www.wikipedia.org/"
}

Great — I can see the page snapshot now. Next I’ll use the Wikipedia search box and search for “Model Context Protocol” (MCP).

Ran Type text 
Completed with input: {
  "ref": "e57",
  "text": "Model Context Protocol MCP",
  "submit": true
}

Nice — Wikipedia has a direct hit for “Model Context Protocol”. Next I’ll open that top result.

Ran Click 
Completed with input: {
  "ref": "e196",
  "element": "Search result link: Model Context Protocol"
}

**Done**
- Opened Wikipedia and found an MCP article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol)
- Confirmed the article title is “Model Context Protocol” and it describes MCP as the “Model Context Protocol (MCP)”.

If you want, I can also open the disambiguation page for “MCP” ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCP)) to show other meanings.
